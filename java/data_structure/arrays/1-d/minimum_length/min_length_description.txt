Problem
You are given two arrays 
 and 
, of length 
. You can select any subarray and then sort the elements in ascending order of that subarray for arrays 
 and 
.

Find the minimum length of the subarray you can choose to make 
 and 
 same after performing the operation. 
 and 
 are permutations of each other.

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer 
 denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 
.
The next line of each test case contains 
 space-separated integers, elements of array 
.
The next line of each test case contains 
 space-separated integers, elements of array 
.
Output Format:

For each test case, print the minimum length of the subarray you can choose to make 
 and 
 same after performing the operation.

Sample Input
2

Explanation
First test case:
We can choose a subarray from index 2 to 3 (1-based indexing). Hence, the answer is 2

Second test case:
We can choose a subarray from index 1 to 3 (1-based indexing). Hence, the answer is 3
